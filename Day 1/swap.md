## What is Swap Memory?

- Swap memory is a part of hard disk that your system uses as a extra memory when your physical RAM is full. 

- When your physical RAM is 100% full, the system moves unused data to the swap space on the hard disk. This frees up the physical RAM for apps that need fast access.

- Swap is slower than RAM because the disk is slower than RAM.

- Too much swap usage can make your system lag.

- On linux, you can check swap using the command `free -h`
