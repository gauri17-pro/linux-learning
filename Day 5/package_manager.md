## What is Package management?

- Introduction:

  Apps like APT are used to install other applications using CLI. 

  APT is basically used to manage applications on Debian-based Linux distributions.

  APT is a command-line version of PlayStore or Appstore 

- What are packages?

  Linux Operating System = Linux Kernel + Other Software Packages ( GNU Utilities or Device drivers )

  Everything other than the kernel is a package in Linux.

- Contents of packages

  The content of the packages managed by these package managers involves the following 4 main components

      1. Binaries or the executable programs
      2. metadata files containing the version, dependencies, signatures, and other relevant information
      3. documentation and manuals
      4. configuration files
  
By keeping these components organized in a certain format, the entire process of installing, updating, and uninstalling software can be automated.
